Welcome to Tsunami Quality of Life

The script is designed in a 4-tier restarter system
30 minutes - Notification/Email letting people know it is a nice CLEAR day
15 minutes - Notification/Email warning people weather has taken a change to RAIN
5 minutes - Notification/Email warning people weather had taken a turn to THUNDER/WATER RISE/BLACKOUT
1 minute - Notification/Email Giving people a final warning to log out of the city

-------------------- Supported Scripts --------------------
Phones:
qb-phone
qs-phone
gks-phone
yflip-phone
Notifications:
qbcore notifications
ox_lib notifications

-------------------- Commands --------------------
/emergencyemail - Send emergency email to everyone
/announcementemail - Send announcement email to everyone
/tsunamimanual - 15 minute tsunami warning
/tsunamishowcase - Shows a complete rundown of the tsunami restart script in a couple of minutes

-------------------- V2 UPDATE --------------------
– Completely removed screen shake/ped movement
– Add a 30min Alert
– added Emergency Alert/Announcement email commands to avoid using txadmin announcements this way players can not rush to read.

-------------------- V3 UPDATE --------------------
–- Now added water level rising system during live schedule restart at 5min warning
–- Added QB/Ox_lib notification config support for people who wish to not use phone emails

-------------------- V3.5 UPDATE --------------------
–- Added Quasar Phone Email config for event emails also during tsunami restart
– Added Quasar Phone Email for tsunamimanual & tsunamishowcase & emergencyemail & announcementemail commands
– Added GKS Phone support for Emails
– Added tsunamishowcase command to show from start to finish only using NOTIFICATIONS QB/Ox_Lib (With restart command added)
– Possible fix for locals driving/swimming underwater (Still needs more testing)

-------------------- BUGS & ISSUES --------------------
–- Locals sometimes still drive/walk underwater
–- Water textures sometimes flicker but not a game-breaking issue
–- You can survive underwater if you are not close to the sea not sure why
